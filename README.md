# Social-Media-Mining-ReWake-Community-Network-Analysis
A Project in Computer Science from the social media mining course of  @ University of Milan


Project Overview
The project leverages the YouTube Data API to collect comments from ReWake's videos, processes the data to identify unique commenters, and constructs a graph where:

Nodes represent individual commenters.

Edges represent relationships between commenters who interact on the same videos.

Key features of the analysis include:

Graph metrics (density, centrality, clustering) to understand community cohesion.

Sentiment analysis (implied by likes/comment text) to gauge emotional engagement.

Temporal patterns to track activity trends.
