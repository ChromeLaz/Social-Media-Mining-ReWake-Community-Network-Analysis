# Social-Media-Mining-ReWake-Community-Network-Analysis
This Python project focuses on mining and analyzing the community of commenters from the YouTube channel @ReWake by modeling their interactions as a network graph. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about the community's structure, relationships, and sentiment patterns.

Project Overview
The project leverages the YouTube Data API to collect comments from ReWake's videos, processes the data to identify unique commenters, and constructs a graph where:

Nodes represent individual commenters.

Edges represent relationships between commenters who interact on the same videos.

Key features of the analysis include:

Graph metrics (density, centrality, clustering) to understand community cohesion.

Sentiment analysis (implied by likes/comment text) to gauge emotional engagement.

Temporal patterns to track activity trends.
